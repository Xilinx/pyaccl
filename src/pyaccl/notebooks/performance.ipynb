    "# ACCL Performance\n",
    "This notebook focuses on performance aspects of ACCL primitives and collectives. We can run the subsequent cells against an emulator or simulator session but hardware is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several factors influencing the duration of an ACCL API call:\n",
    "* the complexity of a call - a copy will be faster than an all-reduce for example\n",
    "* the size (in bytes) of communicated buffers\n",
    "* memory contention between sending and receiving processes. ACCL can be configured in specific ways to minimize this contention, as we will see\n",
    "* network performance, which in itself might depend on the size of buffers i.e. very small buffers typically lead to low utilization of Ethernet bandwidth\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors which should not influence runtime are:\n",
    "* data type - API calls on buffers of the same byte size should take the same amount of time, even if the buffers themselves differ in datatype and number of elements \n",
    "* use of compression - ACCL is designed to perform compression at network rate\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note here is that every ACCL primitive or collective assumes your source and destination buffers are in host memory, onless otherwise specified with the `from_fpga` and `to_fpga` optional arguments that most API calls take. As such, before the operation is initiated, the source data is moved to the FPGA device memory, and after it completes, the resulting data is moved back to host memory. These copies have a performance overhead which typically depends on the size of copied buffers."
